    <th><p>Over 7.5 billion people live on Planet Earth today and it is just as important to every single person as it is to ourselves. Regardless of what part or place on the map we live one, we are all working together to make the world a better place for ourselves and our neighbors. As beautiful as Earth may seem, many people living on it are in pain whether that is from hunger, poverty, illness, etc.</p>
	<p>There are several different ways that we can help our neighbors without even recognizing a major change in our daily lives! Listed below are a few small changes we can make with our daily food consumption that can have a major effect on a family suffering from hunger, and if enough people get together to lend a helping hand to one another, major challenges that the world faces can be illuminated. </p>
	<p>Some people make the argument that they are facing issues providing enough food for themselves and their families, but there are many other ways you can help touch and improve the lives of people suffering from different pains such as feeling neglected. By showing compassion and a friendly smile to someone and letting them know their worth or playing a game with a child, their live could be changed forever. By being a leader and friend to someone, many doors are opened for that person along with the future of our world because people shape the becoming of our future world. </p></th>
